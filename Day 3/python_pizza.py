#Instructor Notes
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. Use the input() function to get a user's preferences and then add up the total for their order and tell them how much they have to pay.

# Small pizza (S): $15

# Medium pizza (M): $20

# Large pizza (L): $25

# Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2

# Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3

# Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1

# Example Interaction
# Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
# What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: L
# Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: Y
# Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: N
# Your final bill is: $28.

#Hint
# Don't change any of the starting code and make sure that the final sentence says "Your final  # bill is: $ ." including the full stop and the same wording. Otherwise, the tests will not pass.
