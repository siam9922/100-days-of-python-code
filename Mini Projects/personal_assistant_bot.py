# üéØ Simple Challenge: "Personal Assistant Bot"
# 
# Description: Create a mini personal assistant that keeps running until the user says goodbye. 
# The assistant can do different helpful tasks, and each task is its own function.
#
# What it does:
# - Greets the user and asks their name
# - Shows a menu of services (like a restaurant menu)
# - User picks what they want help with
# - Assistant does the task using the appropriate function
# - Keeps offering help until user chooses to leave
# - Says a personalized goodbye
#
# Possible services your assistant could offer:
# - Calculate how many days until their birthday
# - Generate a random motivational quote
# - Count how many vowels are in a word they give you
# - Create a simple shopping list
# - Tell them a random fact about their favorite number
# - Make a pattern with their initials
#
# The fun part: Each service is a separate function, but the while loop keeps the 
# "conversation" going. The user feels like they're chatting with a helpful bot 
# that remembers their name and keeps offering new services.
#
# Why it's cool: It feels like a real program someone might actually use, not just 
# a coding exercise. Plus you can add any creative services you want!

#How do you repeat a loop if you have a input inside the loop the loop will automatically repeat if you put on an empty string
