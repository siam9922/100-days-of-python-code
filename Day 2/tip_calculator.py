# We're going to build a tip calculator.

# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

# Each person should pay:

# (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

# After formatting the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

percentage_tip = (tip / 100) + 1.00                 # making the tip like this 1.12
calculation = (bill / people) * percentage_tip      # calculates the split

print(f"The split payment between {people} people is ${round(calculation, 2)}.")
