# Learn to use the Python input() function to collect user input and use it within your code.

# PAUSE 1. Update the code to add an exclamation mark Using what you have learnt in this lesson and previous, can you figure out how take user input and slot it in between 2 strings?

# You are looking to print a sentence like this:

# Hello Name!

# e.g. Hello Angela!
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




#Python Code 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#print("My name is" + " " + "Angela")

#print("Hello" + input("What is your name? "))

#Pause 1
print("Hello " + input("What is your name? ") + "!")




# Programmer Notes

# - Input Function it's where the user has to type an input something from this
#   question.

# - The reason why its green and red because we are in the process of running
#   our code.

# - We can also concatenate both print and input together to create something.

# - Comments are something the computer will ignore. We can keep writing
#   notes. Crlt + / is a shortcut to comment and uncomment code.
