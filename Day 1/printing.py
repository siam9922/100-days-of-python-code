# Programmer Notes
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# - Strings: they are basically a string of characters. The double quotes
#   show the beginning and end of that string of characters.

# - Errors are important to solve any programming issues. For example:
#   Syntax errors are common. Use Google to find a solution if you don't know

# - STACK OVER-FLOW  is a common website to figure out solutions to our code
#   problems. Each solution will help you understand certain code problems.

# - Syntax highlighting give us clues to what is wrong with our programs. By
#    clicking on it, we can find out what it's for.

#- Yellow lines signal warning. They can be ignored. It's good practice
#   to write code by following the warnings.
